## ðŸ§© `Solid::Adapters` Examples

> **Attention:** Each example has its own **README** with more details.

1. [Ports and Adapters](./ports_and_adapters) - Implements the Ports and Adapters pattern. It uses **`Solid::Adapters::Interface`** to provide an interface from the application's core to other layers.

2. [Anti-Corruption Layer](./anti_corruption_layer) - Implements the Anti-Corruption Layer pattern. It uses the **`Solid::Adapters::Proxy`** to define an interface for a set of adapters, which will translate an external interface (`vendors`) to the application's core interface.

3. [Solid::Rails::App](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/tree/solid-process-4?tab=readme-ov-file#-solid-rails-app-) - A Rails application (Web and REST API) made with  `solid-adapters` + [`solid-process`](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-process) that uses the Ports and Adapters (Hexagonal) architectural pattern to decouple the application's core from the framework.
